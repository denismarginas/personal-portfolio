2. Set Repository to Public: Ensure your repository is set to public.
3. Access GitHub Pages Settings: On the repository page in your GitHub account, access the Settings, then the Pages section (e.g., https://github.com/[your-name]/portfolio/settings/pages).
4. Configure GitHub Pages:
   - In the "Build and deployment" section, under "Source," select `Deploy from a branch`.
   - For "Branch", first select `main` (or your custom named branch), and for the second option, select `/ (root)`. Then save the settings.
5. Publish and Apply Changes: Publishing and applying changes from the repository will take 2-5 minutes on GitHub Pages.
6. [Optional] Create a Redirect Page: You can create a public repository with your name and GitHub Pages domain in this form [your-name].github.io. Add an `index.html` page which will redirect users to your portfolio. For example, this can be done easily with a JavaScript code: <script>window.location.href = "/portfolio/";</script>.
