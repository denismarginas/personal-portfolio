                "description": "My full name is Mărginaș Denis Ionuț, I am 25 years old, and I've been working as a front-end web developer and photo-video editor since 2019. I started the first time to work after I finished the university, Math-Informatics profile, till then, I had some hobbies like video editing with cinematics in video games, and I make even freelancing with this hobby. In 2019 I started to work at Pia Soft Product as a web developer and video-photo editor. There I made presentation websites and online shops on platforms like WordPress and Prestashop, SEO optimization, website, and host maintenance, talks with customers, banners, logos, and video advertisements. At this job I had to work alone on my part, which meant I had to learn everything alone from 0, besides the video editing part. Also, I develop web applications in PHP, TPL, SQL, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and more. From the end of 2021, the first job became part-time, at 4 hours, and I started to work full time this time at Netex Romania. Here I was hired as a front-end developer, and I had to do maintenance on a few websites in WordPress and web design. The web design part was more complex, I got templates of pages in a different format, similar to photo, and page section parts, with few instructions, and I had to recreate them in static web pages using HTML, SASS, Node.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery. The project was big, so I started the first time to work alone on my part of it, but also I had meetings with the back-end developers team, and a few months later, a new colleague came to help me on the same part of the project. There I learned for the first time the GitLab platform, git commands, and most importantly teamwork.",
